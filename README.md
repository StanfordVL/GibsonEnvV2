# GIBSON ENVIRONMENT for Embodied Active Agents with Real-World Perception (V2)

**Gibson V2 is an updated version of GibsonEnv, it achieves higher rendering performance and added the ability for robots to interact with objects.**

<img src=misc/ui.gif width="600">

**Summary**: Perception and being active (i.e. having a certain level of motion freedom) are closely tied. Learning active perception and sensorimotor control in the physical world is cumbersome as existing algorithms are too slow to efficiently learn in real-time and robots are fragile and costly. This has given a fruitful rise to learning in the simulation which consequently casts a question on transferring to real-world. We developed Gibson environment with the following primary characteristics:  

**I.** being from the real-world and reflecting its semantic complexity through virtualizing real spaces,  
**II.** having a baked-in mechanism for transferring to real-world (Goggles function), and  
**III.** embodiment of the agent and making it subject to constraints of space and physics via integrating a physics engine ([Bulletphysics](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/)).  

**Naming**: Gibson environment is named after *James J. Gibson*, the author of "Ecological Approach to Visual Perception", 1979. “We must perceive in order to move, but we must also move in order to perceive” – JJ Gibson

Please see the [website](http://gibson.vision/) (http://gibsonenv.stanford.edu/) for more technical details. This repository is intended for distribution of the environment and installation/running instructions.

Release
=================
**This is the gibson2 0.0.1 release. Bug reports, suggestions for improvement, as well as community developments are encouraged and appreciated.** [change log file](misc/CHANGELOG.md).  

**Support for [Gibson v1](http://github.com/StanfordVL/GibsonEnv/) will be moved to this repo**.

Database
=================
The full database includes 572 spaces and 1440 floors and can be downloaded [here](gibson/data/README.md). A diverse set of visualizations of all spaces in Gibson can be seen [here](http://gibsonenv.stanford.edu/database/). To make the core assets download package lighter for the users, we  include a small subset (39) of the spaces. Users can download the rest of the spaces and add them to the assets folder. We also integrated [Stanford 2D3DS](http://3dsemantics.stanford.edu/) and [Matterport 3D](https://niessner.github.io/Matterport/) as separate datasets if one wishes to use Gibson's simulator with those datasets (access [here](gibson/data/README.md)).

Gibson provides a base set of agents. See videos of these agents and their corresponding perceptual observation [here](http://gibsonenv.stanford.edu/agents/). 
<img src=misc/agents.gif>

To enable (optionally) abstracting away low-level control and robot dynamics for high-level tasks, we also provide a set of practical and ideal controllers for each agent.

| Agent Name     | DOF | Information      | Controller |

### Starter Code 

Demonstration examples can be found in `examples/demo` folder. `demo.py` shows the procedure of starting an environment with a random agent.

ROS Configuration
---------

We provide examples of configuring Gibson with ROS [here](examples/ros/gibson-ros). We use turtlebot as an example, after a policy is trained in Gibson, it requires minimal changes to deploy onto a turtlebot. See [README](examples/ros/gibson-ros) for more details.


Coding Your RL Agent
====
You can code your RL agent following our convention. The interface with our environment is very simple (see some examples in the end of this section).

First, you can create an environment by creating an instance of classes in `gibson/core/envs` folder. 


```python
env = AntNavigateEnv(is_discrete=False, config = config_file)
```

Then do one step of the simulation with `env.step`. And reset with `env.reset()`
```python
obs, rew, env_done, info = env.step(action)
```
`obs` gives the observation of the robot. It is a dictionary with each component as a key value pair. Its keys are specified by user inside config file. E.g. `obs['nonviz_sensor']` is proprioceptive sensor data, `obs['rgb_filled']` is rgb camera data.

`rew` is the defined reward. `env_done` marks the end of one episode, for example, when the robot dies. 
`info` gives some additional information of this step; sometimes we use this to pass additional non-visual sensor values.

We mostly followed [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) convention when designing the interface of RL algorithms and the environment. In order to help users start with the environment quicker, we
provide some examples at [examples/train](examples/train). The RL algorithms that we use are from [openAI baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) with some adaptation to work with hybrid visual and non-visual sensory data.
In particular, we used [PPO](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/ppo1) and a speed optimized version of [PPO](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/ppo2).


Environment Configuration
=================
Each environment is configured with a `yaml` file. Examples of `yaml` files can be found in `examples/configs` folder. Parameters for the file is explained below. For more informat specific to Bullet Physics engine, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit).

| Argument name        | Example value           | Explanation  |
|:-------------:|:-------------:| :-----|
| envname      | AntClimbEnv | Environment name, make sure it is the same as the class name of the environment |
| model_id      | space1-space8      |   Scene id, in beta release, choose from space1-space8 |
| target_orn | [0, 0, 3.14]      |   Eulerian angle (in radian) target orientation for navigating, the reference frame is world frame. For non-navigation tasks, this parameter is ignored. |
|target_pos | [-7, 2.6, -1.5] | target position (in meter) for navigating, the reference frame is world frame. For non-navigation tasks, this parameter is ignored. |
|initial_orn | [0, 0, 3.14] | initial orientation (in radian) for navigating, the reference frame is world frame |
|initial_pos | [-7, 2.6, 0.5] | initial position (in meter) for navigating, the reference frame is world frame|
|fov | 1.57  | field of view for the camera, in radian |
| use_filler | true/false  | use neural network filler or not. It is recommended to leave this argument true. See [Gibson Environment website](http://gibson.vision/) for more information. |
|display_ui | true/false  | Gibson has two ways of showing visual output, either in multiple windows, or aggregate them into a single pygame window. This argument determines whether to show pygame ui or not, if in a production environment (training), you need to turn this off |
|show_diagnostics | true/false  | show dignostics(including fps, robot position and orientation, accumulated rewards) overlaying on the RGB image |
|output | [nonviz_sensor, rgb_filled, depth]  | output of the environment to the robot, choose from  [nonviz_sensor, rgb_filled, depth]. These values are independent of `ui_components`, as `ui_components` determines what to show and `output` determines what the robot receives. |
|resolution | 512 | choose from [128, 256, 512] resolution of rgb/depth image |
|mode | gui/headless/web_ui  | gui or headless, if in a production environment (training), you need to turn this to headless. In gui mode, there will be visual output; in headless mode, there will be no visual output. In addition to that, if you set mode to web_ui, it will behave like in headless mode but the visual will be rendered to a web UI server. ([more information](#web-user-interface))|
|verbose |true/false  | show diagnostics in terminal |
|fast_lq_render| true/false| if there is fast_lq_render in yaml file, Gibson will use a smaller filler network, this will render faster but generate slightly lower quality camera output. This option is useful for training RL agents fast. |

#### Making Your Customized Environment
Gibson provides a set of methods for you to define your own environments. You can follow the existing environments inside `gibson/core/envs`.

| Method name        | Usage           |
|:------------------:|:---------------------------|
| robot.get_position() | Get current robot position. |
| robot.get_orientation() | Get current robot orientation. |
| robot.eyes.get_position() | Get current robot perceptive camera position. |
| robot.eyes.get_orientation() | Get current robot perceptive camera orientation. |
| robot.get_target_position() | Get robot target position. |
| robot.apply_action(action) | Apply action to robot. |
| robot.reset_new_pose(pos, orn) | Reset the robot to any pose. |
| robot.dist_to_target() | Get current distance from robot to target. |

Goggles: transferring the agent to real-world
=================
Gibson includes a baked-in domain adaptation mechanism, named Goggles, for when an agent trained in Gibson is going to be deployed in real-world (i.e. operate based on images coming from an onboard camera). The mechanisms is essentially a learned inverse function that alters the frames coming from a real camera to what they would look like if they were rendered via Gibson, and hence, disolve the domain gap. 

<img src=http://gibson.vision/public/img/figure4.jpg width="600">


**More details:** With all the imperfections in point cloud rendering, it has been proven difficult to get completely photo-realistic rendering with neural network fixes. The remaining issues make a domain gap between the synthesized and real images. Therefore, we formulate the rendering problem as forming a joint space ensuring a correspondence between rendered and real images, rather than trying to (unsuccessfully) render images that are identical to real ones. This provides a deterministic pathway for traversing across these domains and hence undoing the gap. We add another network "u" for target image (I_t) and define the rendering loss to minimize the distance between f(I_s) and u(I_t), where "f" and "I_s" represent the filler neural network and point cloud rendering output, respectively (see the loss in above figure). We use the same network structure for f and u. The function u(I) is trained to alter the observation in real-world, I_t, to look like the corresponding I_s and consequently dissolve the gap. We named the u network goggles, as it resembles corrective lenses for the agent for deployment in real-world. Detailed formulation and discussion of the mechanism can be found in the paper. You can download the function u and apply it when you deploy your trained agent in real-world.

In order to use goggle, you will need preferably a camera with depth sensor, we provide an example [here](examples/ros/gibson-ros/goggle.py) for Kinect. The trained goggle functions are stored in `assets/unfiller_{resolution}.pth`, and each one is paired with one filler function. You need to use the correct one depending on which filler function is used. If you don't have a camera with depth sensor, we also provide an example for RGB only [here](examples/demo/goggle_video.py).
